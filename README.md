## Personal Package Protection Locker
The goal of this project is to design a package locker control system that operates on a trust paradigm
opposite that of currently widespread package locker solutions. Current market solutions are designed for
community use and require the individual to fully trust both the mail carrier and the third-party administrator
in control of the community locker solution. This limits the recourse for a victim of package theft postdelivery
due to a compromised mail carrier or system administrator. By placing the full control of a singleresidence
system in the hands of the consumer, a lowcost solution can be delivered to inhibit or prevent post-delivery
package theft, also referred to as “porch piracy,” from occurring further than can be done by community locker
solutions.
